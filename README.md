# INDUCTION PROGRAM 2025
# Day 1
My very first day at GNDEC started with all the CSE and IT students assembling in the college Gurudwara Sahib seeking the blessings of God. The whole atmosphere was filled with the feeling of devotion and hearts filled with excitement and warmth to start this new journey of life.

Then we all headed towards the auditorium with full enthusiasm to attend the inaugural ceremony.Firstly Mr. Harsimran Singh Jaggi, graciously introduced the students to GNDEC's heritage, mission and principles. 

This was followed by engaging addresses from two brilliant alumni Mr. Sangam Arora and Mr. Arshpreet Singh, who spoke about their learnings and how GNDEC influenced their careers. 

Then Mrs. Harpreet Kaur Garewal, Head of the Department of Applied Sciences, who gave a profoundly thoughtful and welcoming speech, urging students to grab every chance with zeal and dedication. 

Dr. Akshay Giddar, Dean Academics, added value by interacting with students and advising them on academic strategies and college culture.
