# Day 1
My very first day at GNDEC started with all the CSE and IT students assembling in the college Gurudwara Sahib seeking the blessings of God. The whole atmosphere was filled with the feeling of devotion and hearts filled with excitement and warmth to start this new journey of life.

Then we all headed towards the auditorium with full enthusiasm to attend the inaugural ceremony.Firstly Mr. Harsimran Singh Jaggi, graciously introduced the students to GNDEC's heritage, mission and principles. 

This was followed by engaging addresses from two brilliant alumni Mr. Sangam Arora and Mr. Arshpreet Singh, who spoke about their learnings and how GNDEC influenced their careers. 

Then Mrs. Harpreet Kaur Garewal, Head of the Department of Applied Sciences, who gave a profoundly thoughtful and welcoming speech, urging students to grab every chance with zeal and dedication. 

Dr. Akshay Giddar, Dean Academics, added value by interacting with students and advising us on academic strategies and college culture.

The highlight was Dr. Sehajpal Singh, Principal of GNDEC, whose forward-thinking words boosted the day's impact.

The institution honored two distinguished Guests of Honour: Shri Ravindra Garg, Chief Engineer, Municipal Corporation, Ludhiana, whose presence and impactful words added immense dignity and relevance. Engineer Rakesh Kumar, a notable alumnus of the 1991 batch and currently ADC, Ludhiana, shared his inspiring journey from GNDEC classrooms to administrative leadership.

Students also interacted with Shri Ashok Singla, Financial Advisor, whose practical insights and encouraging words gave students a fresh perspective on viewing their future.

Then we headed towards our departments where our mentors, HOD's addressed and motivated us for this new journey. 

I learned an essential lesson today- That college life is not only about studying, it's about developing new skills, exploring our inner talents, discovering new passions and creating unforgettable memories. 

So the day ended with motivation, institutional pride giving the CSE and IT students a powerful start to their academic and professional lives.

Our day 2 at GNDEC began with a 2 hour proficiency test of Maths and English to assess our aptitude skills.

The representatives made us aware about their scholarship programs encouraging many students to continue their studies without any financial burden. The lecture also emphasised the right usage of money and how can we become financially independent. 

Then Dr. Arashdeep Singh added value by interacting with students and providing them with food related facts.
